_CHANGES_AMENDMENT_PROMPT_TEMPLATE: str = """
    You are an assistant tasked with extracting changes from a government gazette document.
    Analyze the provided text to identify different types of amendments and extract their details.

    The document is structured using amendment blocks. Each amendment begins with a marker like:
    - (1)
    - (2)
    - (3)

    These indicate individual, self-contained changes. Each block represents **one distinct amendment** such as a deletion, insertion, update, or re-numbering.

    Focus on identifying explicit operations like "By deleting", "By insertion of the following new Heading", "is as follows" (indicating an update/redefinition), and "By re-numbering".

    Return a JSON array where each object represents a single amendment operation.

    Each object in the array should have an "operation_type" key, and a "details" key.
    The "operation_type" can be one of the following: "DELETION", "INSERTION", "UPDATE", "RENUMBERING".

    Here are the details to extract for each operation type:

    1.  For "DELETION" operations:
        -   "heading_number": The number of the heading being deleted (e.g., "No. 3.0").
        -   "heading_name": The name of the Minister or State Minister heading being deleted (e.g., "Minister of Finance").
        -   "deleted_sections": A list of the specific sub-sections explicitly mentioned as being deleted (e.g., ["Purview", "Subjects & Functions"]). If the entire heading is deleted and sub-sections aren't individually listed, state "All associated sections".

    2.  For "INSERTION" operations:
        -   "heading_number": The number of the new heading (e.g., "3.0").
        -   "heading_name": The name of the new Minister or State Minister heading (e.g., "Minister of Economic Policies & Plan Implementation").
        -   "purview": (Optional) The text of the "Purview" section, if present.
        -   "subjects_and_functions": (Optional) A list of strings, each representing a subject or function.
        -   "special_priorities": (Optional) A list of strings, each representing a special priority.
        -   "related_institutional_and_legal_framework": (Optional) An object containing:
            -   "departments_and_institutions": A list of strings, each representing a department or institution.
            -   "laws_and_ordinances": A list of strings, each representing a law or ordinance.

    3.  For "UPDATE" operations (indicated by "is as follows" for an existing heading or a specific section under a heading):
        -   "previous_heading_number": The original heading number being updated 
        -   "previous_heading_name": The original name of the Minister or State Minister before the update 
        -   "heading_number": The number of the heading being updated (e.g., "No. 5.1").
        -   "heading_name": The name of the Minister or State Minister heading being updated.
        -   "updated_content": An object containing the new or updated content. This can include:
            -   "purview": (Optional) The new text of the "Purview" section.
            -   "subjects_and_functions": (Optional) A list of new or updated subjects/functions.
            -   "special_priorities": (Optional) A list of new or updated special priorities.
            -   "related_institutional_and_legal_framework": (Optional) An object with new departments/institutions and laws/ordinances.
            -   If only a specific sub-section is updated (e.g., "04. Related Institutional and Legal Framework" under a Minister), explicitly mention that sub-section.

    4.  For "RENUMBERING" operations:
        -   "previous_number": The original heading number.
        -   "new_number": The new heading number.
        -   "heading_name": The name of the Minister or State Minister whose heading is re-numbered.
        
    5.  If a change does not clearly match any of the above categories (DELETION, INSERTION, UPDATE, RENUMBERING),
        use an appropriate custom "operation_type" that best fits the nature of the change. This could be something like:
        - "REALLOCATION"
        - "RESTRUCTURING"
        - "CLARIFICATION"
        - "MERGE"
        - "SPLIT"
        - "OTHER"

        In such cases:
        - Provide a descriptive name as "operation_type"
        - Still use a "details" dictionary to describe what is happening as specifically as possible
        - Include any fields that are extractable, such as involved minister names, affected laws, or textual edits

        This ensures no change is skipped even if it doesn't perfectly match the predefined categories.


    Ensure the JSON output is compact, without any additional formatting or escape characters like triple backticks.
    If a section is not applicable or not found for a specific operation, omit it or use an empty list/object.
